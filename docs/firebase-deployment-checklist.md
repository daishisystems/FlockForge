- [ ] Read cached document while offline
- [ ] Update document while offline
- [ ] Delete document while offline
- [ ] Sync changes when back online

#### Data Validation
- [ ] Required fields validation
- [ ] Data type validation
- [ ] Business rule validation
- [ ] Firestore security rules enforcement

### 3. Error Handling Testing

- [ ] Handle concurrent modifications

### 4. Performance Testing
- [ ] App startup time with Firebase initialization
- [ ] Authentication response time
- [ ] Firestore query performance
- [ ] Offline data loading speed
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Battery usage impact

### 5. Security Testing
- [ ] Firestore security rules prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] User can only access their own data
- [ ] Sensitive data is not exposed in logs
- [ ] Authentication tokens are securely stored
- [ ] SSL/TLS encryption for all communications

## Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Firebase Console Configuration
1. **Create Production Project**
   ```
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Create new project or use existing
   - Enable Authentication and Firestore
   ```

2. **Configure Authentication**
   ```
   - Enable Email/Password provider
   - Configure OAuth providers (Google, Apple)
   - Set up authorized domains
   ```

3. **Deploy Firestore Rules**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

4. **Configure Firestore Indexes**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

### 2. App Configuration
1. **Update Firebase Configuration**
   - Replace development config files with production versions
   - Update `FirebaseConfig.cs` with production settings
   - Verify all API keys and project IDs

2. **Build Configuration**
   - Set build configuration to Release
   - Enable code obfuscation
   - Verify all debug code is removed

### 3. Platform-Specific Deployment

#### Android
1. **Google Play Console**
   - Upload APK/AAB to Play Console
   - Configure app signing
   - Set up release tracks (internal, alpha, beta, production)

2. **Firebase App Distribution** (Optional)
   ```bash
   firebase appdistribution:distribute app-release.apk \
     --app 1:123456789:android:abcd1234 \
     --groups "testers"
   ```

#### iOS
1. **App Store Connect**
   - Upload IPA to App Store Connect
   - Configure app metadata
   - Submit for review

2. **TestFlight** (Optional)
   - Distribute to internal testers
   - Collect feedback before production release

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### 1. Firebase Analytics
- [ ] Monitor user authentication events
- [ ] Track app usage patterns
- [ ] Monitor crash reports
- [ ] Analyze performance metrics

### 2. Firestore Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor read/write operations
- [ ] Track query performance
- [ ] Monitor storage usage
- [ ] Check security rule violations

### 3. Error Monitoring
- [ ] Set up crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)
- [ ] Monitor authentication failures
- [ ] Track network errors
- [ ] Monitor app performance

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Issues
**Problem**: Users can't sign in
**Solutions**:
- Verify Firebase configuration files are correct
- Check authentication providers are enabled
- Verify network connectivity
- Check Firestore security rules

**Problem**: Users get logged out frequently
**Solutions**:
- Check token refresh implementation
- Verify offline persistence is working
- Check for memory pressure issues

#### Firestore Issues
**Problem**: Data not syncing
**Solutions**:
- Verify Firestore rules allow access
- Check network connectivity
- Verify offline persistence is enabled
- Check for quota limits

**Problem**: Permission denied errors
**Solutions**:
- Review Firestore security rules
- Verify user authentication state
- Check document ownership

#### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Slow app startup

   - Disable problematic Firebase features if possible
   - Communicate with users about known issues

2. **Firebase Rollback**
   - Revert Firestore security rules to previous version
   - Disable new authentication providers if causing issues
   - Restore previous Firebase configuration

3. **Code Rollback**
   - Revert to previous stable commit
   - Rebuild and redeploy app
