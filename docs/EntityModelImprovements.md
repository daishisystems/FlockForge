# FlockForge Entity Model Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the FlockForge entity models to align them with the application requirements specification. These enhancements ensure that the entity models are complete and ready for Firebase integration.

## Implemented Improvements

### Farmer Entity
Added the following missing fields to align with the app specification:
- **City** - Text input with autocomplete
- **Province** - Dropdown/picker with predefined options
- **Zip Code** - Text input with format validation
- **Sub Region** - Text input

Additional methods:
- `UpdateAddress()` - Method to update all address-related fields at once

### Farm Entity
Added the following missing field:
- **Co Op** - Text input for cooperative information

Additional methods:
- `UpdateCoOp()` - Method to update cooperative information

### BreedingRecord Entity
Added the following missing fields:
- **UsedFollowUpRams** - Yes/no toggle for follow-up rams usage
- **FollowUpRamsIn** - Date picker for when follow-up rams were introduced
- **FollowUpRamsOut** - Date picker for when follow-up rams were removed
- **DaysIn** - Auto-calculated field for duration follow-up rams were present
- **YearCalculationDate** - Date picker for year calculation
- **Year** - Auto-populated from date (computed property)

Additional methods:
- `UpdateFollowUpRams()` - Method to update follow-up rams information
- `UpdateYearCalculationDate()` - Method to update the year calculation date

### ScanningRecord Entity
Added the following missing fields:
- **EwesMated** - Auto-populated from breeding data
- **ScannedFetuses** - Numeric input for total fetuses scanned
- **ExpectedLambingPercentageOfPregnant** - Auto-calculated percentage
- **ExpectedLambingPercentageOfMated** - Auto-calculated percentage

Additional methods:
- `UpdateEwesMated()` - Method to update the number of ewes mated
- `UpdateScannedFetuses()` - Method to update the scanned fetuses count

### WeaningRecord Entity
Added the following missing fields:
- **RamsWeaned** - Numeric input for number of rams weaned
- **BreedingEwesDeadFromScan** - Numeric input for breeding ewes that died after scanning
- **OtherMortalities** - Numeric input for other mortalities
- **OtherMortalityCategory** - Text input for categorizing other mortalities

## Validation Enhancements

### BreedingRecord Validation
Enhanced validation to include follow-up rams date validation:
- Follow-up rams in date is required when follow-up rams are used
- Follow-up rams out date is required when follow-up rams are used
- Follow-up rams out date cannot be before follow-up rams in date

### ScanningRecord Validation
Enhanced validation to include scanned fetuses validation:
- Scanned fetuses count cannot be negative

## Next Steps for Firebase Integration

### Data Mapping
The entity models are now fully aligned with the app specification and ready for Firebase integration:

1. **Farmer Collection**
   - Map all Farmer entity properties to Firestore documents
   - Include subcollections for related data (farms)

2. **Farm Collection**
   - Map all Farm entity properties to Firestore documents
   - Include subcollections for related data (lambing seasons)

3. **Lambing Seasons Collection**
   - Map all LambingSeason entity properties to Firestore documents
   - Include subcollections for related data (breeding records, scanning records, etc.)

4. **Production Records Collections**
   - Map all production record entities to their respective Firestore collections

### Offline Support
The entity models include an `IsSynced` property that can be used to track synchronization status with Firebase:
- When `IsSynced` is false, data needs to be synchronized with Firebase
- When `IsSynced` is true, data is synchronized with Firebase

### Security Considerations
The entity models maintain user data isolation through:
- **FarmerId** references in Farm entities
- **FarmId** references in LambingSeason entities
- **LambingSeasonId** references in production record entities

This hierarchical structure supports Firebase security rules that ensure users can only access their own data.

## Conclusion

The entity model improvements have successfully addressed all the gaps identified in the requirements analysis. The models now fully align with the app specification and are ready for Firebase integration. The additional fields and methods provide the necessary data structure and business logic to support all the features described in the requirements document.

These improvements position the FlockForge application well for implementing the remaining phases of the roadmap:
- Phase 2: Firebase Integration
- Phase 3: Offline Sync Implementation
- Phase 4: ViewModels and Business Logic
- Phase 5: UI Implementation and Testing
