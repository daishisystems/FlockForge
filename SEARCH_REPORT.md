# Search Report: Prior Offending Sites and Remediation

## Memory Leaks (HIGH Priority)

### 1. Undisposed Observers
**Prior Issues:**
- AppDelegate.cs had direct NSNotificationCenter observers without proper disposal
- No centralized disposal pattern for pages and view models

**Remediation:**
- Created `BaseContentPage` and `BaseViewModel` with `CompositeDisposable` pattern
- Updated all existing pages (LoginPage, RegisterPage, MainPage) to implement IDisposable pattern
- Created `ObserverManager` in AppDelegate to properly manage and dispose observers
- Added shell-level safety net in AppShell.xaml.cs to clear disposables on navigation

### 2. Firestore Listeners
**Prior Issues:**
- FirestoreService had listeners that were not properly disposed
- No mechanism for callers to dispose listeners

**Remediation:**
- Enhanced FirestoreService to return IDisposable for listeners
- Created `ActionDisposable` wrapper class for proper disposal
- Updated service to track and dispose all active listeners on disposal

### 3. Event Subscriptions
**Prior Issues:**
- Event subscriptions that were not properly unsubscribed
- No centralized mechanism for managing event subscriptions

**Remediation:**
- Created `EventDisposable` adapter class
- Provided mechanism to convert event subscriptions to disposables
- Integrated with CompositeDisposable pattern for automatic cleanup

## Font Registration (MEDIUM Priority)

### 1. Duplicate Font Sources
**Prior Issues:**
- UIAppFonts entries in Info.plist causing duplicate registration
- Potential for multiple copies of font files

**Remediation:**
- Removed UIAppFonts entries from Info.plist
- Verified single source of truth in Resources/Fonts directory
- Confirmed .csproj uses wildcard pattern for font inclusion

### 2. Runtime Manual Registration
**Prior Issues:**
- UIFont.FamilyNames check in MauiProgram.cs could potentially cause issues

**Remediation:**
- Verified existing check is correct implementation per requirements
- UIFont call is properly guarded with #if IOS directive
- No duplicate registration occurs due to existing guard logic

## iOS Code Guards
**Prior Issues:**
- Some iOS-specific code might not be properly guarded

**Remediation:**
- Verified all iOS-specific code is behind #if IOS directives
- No unguarded iOS code found in the codebase

## Summary
All identified issues have been addressed with proper disposal patterns, centralized management, and verification of iOS-specific code guards. The implementation follows the specified requirements with:
- Base classes for disposal management
- Page â†” ViewModel lifecycle wiring
- Proper iOS observer disposal pattern
- Disposable wrappers for Firestore listeners and events
- Shell-level safety net
- Clean font registration without duplicates
- All iOS code properly guarded
